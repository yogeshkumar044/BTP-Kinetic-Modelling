# B.Tech Project - Kinetic Modeling of Friedel-Crafts Acylation

This repository contains the Python code and data for the B.Tech project report.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Code

1.  **Data File:** The experimental data is in `FCR_BTP2.csv`.
2.  **Models:** The 7 kinetic models are in their own `.ipynb` notebook files.
3.  **Interactive Version:** To run this code interactively, you can open the notebooks in Google Colab.

## Models
* `PH_model.ipynb`: Pseudo-Homogeneous Model
* `ER_model_A.ipynb`: Eley-Rideal (A adsorbed)
* `ER_model_B.ipynb`: Eley-Rideal (B adsorbed)
* `LHHW_model_1.ipynb`: LHHW Single-Site (Reactants)
* `LHHW_model_2.ipynb`: LHHW Single-Site (Reactants & Products)
* `LHHW_model_3.ipynb`: LHHW Dual-Site (Reactants)
* `LHHW_model_4.ipynb`: LHHW Dual-Site (Reactants & Products)
